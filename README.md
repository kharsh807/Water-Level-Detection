# Water-Level-Detection using iot

This project is created using a ESP8266(NodeMCU) and the data is shown in the BLYNK app.

## Introduction
IoT-based water level monitoring provides automatic detection of liquid levels from differently sized tanks or storage containers. It is a state-of-the-art system specially designed to inform the users about the real status of the liquid levels. For finding the level of the water in a container we are using an ultrasonic sensor. Also, we are going to display the water percentage on the users smart phone.

## Components Used
1.NodeMCU (ESP8266)
2.Ultrasonic Sensor
3.Jumper Wires
